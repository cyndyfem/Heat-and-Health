The Unseen Effort of Staying Comfortable,  Understanding Human Body Exergy Consumption


It's Not Just Energy, It's Exergy
Traditional thermal comfort models focus on energy balance (the First Law of Thermodynamics), treating all energy forms as equal. But to truly understand comfort, we need to consider the quality of that energy.

Exergy, grounded in the Second Law of Thermodynamics, measures the maximum useful work potential of energy. It quantifies the "effort" your body exerts to maintain its internal temperature against the environment. Less effort means more comfort and higher physiological efficiency.
